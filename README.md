# brain-tumor-segmentation

* Developed by: Apoorva Goswami

* The task at hand involves the segmentation of gliomas in pre-operative MRI scans, where the goal is to assign labels to each pixel in the image. Pixels within the tumor area are categorized into distinct classes or sub-regions, including the "enhancing tumor" (ET), the "tumor core" (TC), and the "whole tumor" (WT), each represented by values 1, 2, and 3, respectively. Pixels outside the tumor regions are labeled as 0. The segmentation labels designate 1 for non-enhancing tumor and necrosis (NCR & NET), 2 for edema (ED), 4 for enhancing tumor (ET), and 0 for areas unrelated to the tumor.
